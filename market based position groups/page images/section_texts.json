    "Rookie Salary - Determine Rookie Cost": "The <a href='https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/draft/_/year/2024'>rookie wage scale</a> has been consistent since the 2011 CBA. The previous 4 years were used to define % cap vs draft pick.",
    
	"Draft Performance Fit (a) - Determine Performance vs Draft Pick": "PFR's AV per game (wAVpG) was used to measure player performance. iDL drafted since 2011 with at least one additional contract are shown in the graph. Various curve fits and their relative errors are overlaid and labeled. Draft surplus studies vary by their chosen performance metric.",
    
	"Draft Performance Fit (b)": "The relationship between performance and pick is more apparent with box plots for narrow pick ranges. The final two fit choices are shown, and differ after the 3rd round. Which better captures the data?",
    
	"Draft Performance Fit (c)": "Gamma GLM was chosen for simplicity, though the 3d polynomial fit had less error. Along with the curve, the players with the highest positive and negative residuals are highlighted. Expected performance and salary cap vs draft pick has now been established!",
    
	"Market Data Top Contracts": "For this section, players' second contracts were used to analyze the market. Players' max contracts will be discussed later.<br><br>This plot provides a sense of the premium iDL market over the last few years. The 90th percentile second contract and performance are listed for each draft class, in addition to the class's top contract. Note that the 2021 class can still play this 2024 season on their rookie contracts.",
    
	"Market Data vs Performance": "Here all second contracts are shown against performance, with selected points labeled. Note that two 'Chris Jones' got lumped together, and the bottom right point is not real.<br><br>The second contract market fit will attempt to capture only the top performers.",
    
	"Market Performance Fit (a) - Determine Veteran Cost vs Performance": "Various curve fits are shown for the upper end of iDL market data. A 80th percentile contract cutoff was used as a starting point.",
    
	"Market Performance Fit (b)": "The salary cap minimum was increased to the 88th percentile (6.8% cap) and the final two fit choices are shown. Note that 'Splines' is a smoothed interpolation and included for reference.<br><br>Both fits are adequate for the chosen region, but their extrapolations do not capture the bottom of the market. Robust Least Squares fits were used for all market data.",
    
	"Final Curve Fits": "In summary, performance was fit against draft pick and veteran market rate. For a given performance, rookie cost can be estimated by matching it to a draft pick, market cost can be estimated with the market rate fit, and the difference between the two is the draft surplus value.<br><br>Gamma GLM or 3d polynomials were used for all draft data.",
    
	"Surplus Value vs Draft Pick": "This plot shows a 'traditional' draft surplus analysis, represented by the green <span style='color:green;'>'raw surplus'</span> trace. It is the difference in <span style='color:darkorange;'>'market rate'</span> and <span style='color:royalblue;'>'rookie cap'</span>. Market rate was matched to draft pick using performance (wAVpG).<br><br>For iDL, the lower bound of market rate performance occurs at the equivalent of draft pick 80. The surplus curve is filled until surplus lowers below that of the first overall pick, 87 for iDL. Surplus peaks at pick 17.",
    
	"Surplus value vs Performance": "Here <span style='color:green;'>'surplus value'</span> is shown against performance (wAVpG). The solid lines indicate the region of performance overlap, where it is 'fair' to report a surplus value.<br><br>The equivalent draft round and final overlapping pick are labelled on the <span style='color:royalblue;'>'rookie contract' curve</span>. A player close to the <span style='color:darkorange;'>market fit</span> was chosen to illustrate surplus value, the arrows indicate their actual draft pick to their equivalent pick performance.",
    
	"iDL draft surplus": "The previous analysis is condensed into the following grid. Compare it to the following grids for EDGE and Offensive Tackle.",
    
	"EDGE draft surplus": "Draft performance for EDGE is similar to iDL, but market cost is higher than iDL for a similar wAVpG. Play with the scroll bar to compare EDGE and iDL. Direct comparisons to follow.",
    
	"Offensive Tackle (T) draft surplus": "Draft performance for Tackle is similar to the previous positions, but the market rate curve is much flatter. Accordingly, the overlap region for Tackle is the smallest.",
    
	"Surplus vs Pick comparison": "Draft surplus for each position is shown, along with their peak value. iDL and EDGE are similar, but more savings is expected with EDGE given the higher market cost. As mentioned, Tackle has a much different surplus shape, given its market fit.",
	
	"Surplus vs Performance comparison": "Surplus vs performance for each position is shown, along with their peak value and equivalent pick. Recall the lower end of performance overlap is bound by the market fit, and the upper end by the draft performance fit.",
	
	"Next Contract Difference vs Draft Round": "Here is another way to visualize the markets for EDGE, iDL, and Tackle. The y-axis shows the difference in second contract and rookie contract, grouped by draft round.<br><br>The last rounds can achieve up to 3% cap more change than the first few picks, given the rookie wage scale. But it is much less likely for a late pick to achieve and earn a top contract. They are also less likely to earn significantly less with their next contract.",
	
	"Max Vet Contract vs Draft Round": "Here the maximum vet contract for each position is grouped by round. As with the previous set of graphs, the relatively high market floor for Tackle is apparent.<br><br>Only veteran contracts were considered. The proportion of players with reduced salary after their rookie deal is listed on each graph.",
	
	"Market Fit Comparison: iDL": "As mentioned, both second and maximum veteran contracts were used to determine market rates for each position. Typically second contract fits were flatter and bound to a higher performance region. Max contract fits tend to look better for a greater proportion of the market data. Contract cutoffs were individually determined for each fit.<br><br>For iDL performance bounds are similar, but the max contract fit covers a wider salary range and has a sharper slope.",
	
	"Market Fit Comparison: EDGE": "Similar to iDL, the max market fit for EDGE covers a wider salary range and has a slightly sharper slope.",
	
	"Market Fit Comparison: Tackle": "The second and max contract fits are most different for Tackle. The performance and salary bounds for the max fit are wider, and the slope is 3x that of the second contract fit!",
	
	"Surplus vs Pick comparison (max contract fit)": "Now positions are compared using their max contract market fit. Tackle shows a more similar shape to the other positions, and has a much wider overlap region than with the second contract market fit.<br><br>All positions show peak surplus between picks 10 and 20. Surplus decays least rapidly for Tackle.",
	
	"Surplus vs Performance comparison (max contract fit)": "The relationships for surplus vs performance are more similar with the max market fits, too."
