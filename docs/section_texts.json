    "Rookie Salary - Determine Rookie Cost": "The <a href='https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/draft/_/year/2024'>rookie wage scale</a> has been consistent since the 2011 CBA. The previous 4 years were used to define % cap vs draft pick.",
    
	"Draft Performance Fit (a) - Determine Performance vs Draft Pick": "Draft surplus studies vary by their chosen performance metric.<br><br>For this example, <a href='https://www.pro-football-reference.com/about/approximate_value.htm'>PFR's AV</a> per game (wAVpG) was used to measure player performance. iDL drafted since 2011 with at least one additional contract are shown in the graph. Various curve fits and their relative errors are overlaid and labeled.",
    
	"Draft Performance Fit (b) - Fit Selection Finalists": "The relationship between performance and pick is more apparent with box plots for narrow pick ranges. The final two fit choices are shown, and only deviate after the Round 3. Which better captures the data?",
    
	"Draft Performance Fit (c) - Fit Selection Outliers": "<a href='https://www.statsmodels.org/devel/generated/statsmodels.genmod.families.family.Gamma.html#statsmodels.genmod.families.family.Gamma'>Gamma</a> <a href='https://www.statsmodels.org/devel/generated/statsmodels.genmod.generalized_linear_model.GLM.html#statsmodels.genmod.generalized_linear_model.GLM'>GLM</a> was chosen for simplicity, though the <a href='https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.polyfit.html'>3d polynomial fit</a> had less error. Along with the curve, the players with the highest positive and negative residuals are highlighted. Expected performance and salary cap vs draft pick has now been established!<br><br>Gamma GLM or 3d polynomials were used for all draft data.",
    
	"Market Data Top Contracts - Top Second Contracts vs Season": "For this example, players' second contracts were used to analyze the market. Players' max contracts will be discussed later.<br><br>This plot provides a sense of the premium iDL market over the last few years. The 90th percentile second contract and performance are listed for each draft class, in addition to the class's top contract (listed below each year label). Note that the 2021 class could still play the 2024 season on their rookie contracts, and therefore is lower than the rest.",
    
	"Market Data vs Performance - Fit will allow comparison to draft.": "Here all second contracts are shown against performance, with selected points labeled. Note that multiple 'Chris Jones' got muddled and some labeled points are not real.<br><br>The second contract market fit will attempt to capture only the top earners.",
    
	"Market Performance Fit (a) - Determine Veteran Cost vs Performance": "Various curve fits are shown for the upper end of iDL market. A 80th percentile contract cutoff was used as a starting point to separate the top earners from the rest.<br><br>Refer to <a href='https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/regression.html#linear-regression'>statmodels documentation</a> for information about the first three fits listed.",
    
	"Market Performance Fit (b) - Fit Selection Finalists": "The salary cap minimum was increased to the 88th percentile (6.8% cap) and the final two fit choices are shown. Note that 'Splines' is a smoothed interpolation and included for reference. <a href='https://www.statsmodels.org/devel/generated/statsmodels.robust.robust_linear_model.RLM.html#statsmodels.robust.robust_linear_model.RLM'>Robust Linear Models</a> were used for all market data.<br><br>Both fits are adequate for the chosen region, but their extrapolations do not capture the bottom of the market. The lower bounds of market performance fits will be indicated when comparing costs to rookies.",
    
	"Final Curve Fits - Draft and Market Comparison": "In summary, performance was related to draft pick and veteran market rate. For a given performance (wAVpG), rookie cost can be estimated by matching it to a draft pick, and veteran cost can be estimated with the market rate fit. Similarly to the draft fit graph, the highest (Casey) and lowest (Wilkins) value contracts are labeled on the second graph.<br><br>The difference between the market and draft fits is the draft surplus value: given the fit cost (measured by draft pick or market rate) vs performance, it is the cost savings of drafting a similarly performing player instead of paying the market rate.",
    
	"Surplus Value vs Draft Pick - Traditional Representation": "This plot shows a 'traditional' draft surplus analysis, represented by the green <span style='color:green;'>'raw surplus'</span> trace. It is the difference in <span style='color:darkorange;'>'market rate'</span> and <span style='color:royalblue;'>'rookie cap'</span>. Market rate was matched to draft pick using performance (wAVpG).<br><br>For iDL, the lower bound of market rate performance occurs at the equivalent of draft pick 80. Cost should not be compared after this pick, given the bounds of the market fit.<br><br>The surplus curve is filled until surplus lowers below that of the first overall pick, after pick 87 for iDL. Surplus peaks at pick 17.",
    
	"Surplus Value vs Performance - Alternative Representation": "Here <span style='color:green;'>'surplus value'</span> is shown against performance (wAVpG) instead of draft pick. The solid lines indicate the region of performance overlap, where it is 'fair' to report a surplus value (extent of market fit).<br><br>The equivalent draft round and final overlapping pick are labelled on the <span style='color:royalblue;'>'rookie contract' curve</span>. A player close to the <span style='color:darkorange;'>market fit</span> was chosen to illustrate surplus value, the arrows indicate their actual draft pick to their equivalent pick performance.<br><br>The blue dotted line and arrow directions show that Kenny Clark's career performance exceeds the expectation for his draft pick, and the length of the green dotted line represents his surplus value.",
    
	"iDL Draft Surplus - Analysis Summary": "The previous analysis is condensed into graphs below. The two surplus representations are shown in the top row, and the draft and market fits are shown in the bottom row.<br><br>Compare it to the following series for EDGE and Offensive Tackle.",
    
	"EDGE Draft Surplus": "Draft performance for EDGE is similar to iDL, but market cost is higher than iDL for a similar wAVpG.<br><br>Scroll back and forth to compare EDGE and iDL. Direct comparisons will be shown below.",
    
	"Offensive Tackle (T) Draft Surplus": "Draft performance for Tackle is similar to the previous positions, but the market rate curve is much flatter. Accordingly, the overlap region for Tackle is the smallest.<br><br>Perhaps a greater range of contracts should have been considered to determine the market rate.",
    
	"Surplus vs Pick - Position Comparison": "Draft surplus for each position is shown, along with their peak value. iDL and EDGE are similar, but more savings is expected with EDGE given the higher market cost. As mentioned, Tackle has a much different surplus shape, given its market fit.<br><br>Peak surplus and associated draft picks indicated on the curve peaks, and the fit overlap regions and associated draft picks are indicated by line style and labeled on the x-axis.",
	
	"Surplus vs Performance - Position Comparison": "Surplus vs performance for each position is shown, along with their peak value and equivalent pick. Recall the lower end of performance overlap is bound by the market fit (left), and the upper end by the draft performance fit (right).",
	
	"Second Contract Difference vs Draft Round - Expected Cost Change vs Draft Round": "Here is another way to visualize draft surplus for EDGE, iDL, and Tackle. The y-axis shows the difference in second contract and rookie contract, grouped by draft round.<br><br>The highest changes tend to be late first round or second round picks, recall that rookie cost flattens dramatically after the second round. It is less likely for a late draft pick to achieve and earn a top contract. They are also less likely to earn significantly less with their next contract (below dotted lines, with overall percentage listed).",
	
	"Max Vet Contract vs Draft Round - Max contract allows for broader cost comparisons.": "Here the maximum vet contract for each position is grouped by round. As with the previous set of graphs, the relatively high market floor for Tackle is apparent.<br><br>Only veteran contracts were considered. The proportion of players whose max salary occured with their rookie deal is listed on each graph.",
	
	"Market Fit Comparison: iDL Second and Maximum Veteran Contracts": "For iDL performance bounds for the market fits are similar, but the max contract fit covers a wider salary range and has a sharper slope.<br><br>Typically second contract fits were flatter and bound to a higher performance region. Max contract fits tend to look better for a greater proportion of the market data. Contract cutoffs were individually determined for each fit.",
	
	"Market Fit Comparison: EDGE Second and Maximum Veteran Contracts": "Similar to iDL, the max market fit for EDGE covers a wider salary range and has a slightly sharper slope. Recall that contract cutoffs (market percentiles) were individually determined for each fit, and are shown on the <span style='color:grey;'>grey dotted line</span>.",
	
	"Market Fit Comparison: Tackle Second and Maximum Veteran Contracts": "The difference in market fits are more dramatic for Tackle than EDGE or iDL. The performance and salary bounds for the max fit are wider, and the slope (right label on dotted line) is 3x that of the second contract fit!",
	
	"Surplus vs Pick Comparison - Max Contract Variation": "Now positions are compared using their max contract market fit. Tackle shows a more similar shape to the other positions, and has a much wider overlap region than with the second contract market fit.<br><br>All positions show peak surplus between picks 10 and 20. Surplus decays least rapidly for Tackle.",
	
	"Surplus vs Performance Comparison - Max Contract Variation": "The relationships for surplus vs performance are more similar for these three positions with the max market fits, too. This graphs shows most clearly that the fit overlap region (extent of fair cost comparison) is greater when using max contract instead of second contract."
