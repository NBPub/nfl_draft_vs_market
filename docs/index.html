		    9 | Final Curve Fits - Draft and Market Comparison<br><br>
		    In summary, performance was related to draft pick and veteran market rate. For a given performance (wAVpG), rookie cost can be estimated by matching it to a draft pick, and veteran cost can be estimated with the market rate fit. Similarly to the draft fit graph, the highest (Casey) and lowest (Wilkins) value contracts are labeled on the second graph.<br><br>The difference between the market and draft fits is the draft surplus value: given the fit cost (measured by draft pick or market rate) vs performance, it is the cost savings of drafting a similarly performing player instead of paying the market rate.

It is the difference in <span style='color:darkorange;'>'market rate'</span> and <span style='color:royalblue;'>'rookie cap'</span>. Market rate was matched to draft pick using performance (wAVpG).<br><br>For iDL, the lower bound of market rate performance occurs at the equivalent of draft pick 80.
