		    PFR's AV per game (wAVpG) was used to measure player performance. iDL drafted since 2011 with at least one additional contract are shown in the graph. Various curve fits and their relative errors are overlaid and labeled. Draft surplus studies vary by their chosen performance metric.

		    In summary, performance was related to draft pick and veteran market rate.
